# interrail_route

This application creates a well formatted json file of the full data of your interrail/eurail trip and a reduced csv file.

Python3.x is required as well as the shared link of your interrail/eurail trip to run this script.
(You can check whether python 3.x is installed or not by running python --version)

Just open your console or terminal and run the following command (with replaced url) from the same folder where the get_route.py file is located:
## python get_route.py --url "https://share.eurailapp.com/xxxx"
(quotation marks mandatory)
