# interrail_route

This application creates a well formated json file of the full data of your interrail trip and a reduced csv file.

To run this script python3.x is required as well as the shared link of your interrail trip.

Simply open your console or terminal and run the following command (with replaced url) from the same folder in which the get_route.py file is in:
## python3 get_route.py --url https://share.eurailapp.com/xxxx
